# Introduction
The new COVID-19 virus is testing our country, our society and us as citizens. Everything normal about our daily lives has been put on hold. Life, health, and jobs are threatened.
In this critical moment, our task is to work together as a nation to solve one of the biggest crises of our lifetime. Hack the Crisis is an online hackathon organized by DIGG, Hack for Sweden, Openhack and The Swedish Government.
The mission is to design, test and execute ideas for the future of Sweden and the world. We want to gather creative ideas and develop concepts in an attempt to create solutions helping us make further progress in the ongoing resistance.
This hackathon is a context for all parts of society to contribute â€“ public sector, private sector, academia, non-profit organizations and citizens, who want to join in the fight.

# Title

HowAreYouFeelingToday

# 1. Short Pitch
> Describe your solution in short (3 sentences).   

People are self-isolating, or feeling overwhelmed by this crisis both physically and emotionally. Or plan is to create a platform recording both symptoms and some "wellness" data. This data will then be analysed, graphed and shared to make sure that possible interventions can be taken to mideate issues that arise and allocate resources needed to counteract them.

Realisability, Benefit for society, Scalability, Comprehensibility.

# 2. Problem Description
> Please describe the problem you are trying to solve as precisely as possible. What problem has COVID-19 caused and how does it affect your target group?

A lot of people are experiencing psychological issues due to the current situation, either because they have been personally affected by it (by getting infected, or loosing their job), or due to the prolong times of isolation, social distancing and quarantine. This can cause a lot of people to feel deeply anxious or even depressed.   
In a culmination of all the above a lot of people experiencing severe symptoms choose to self-quarantine to limit transmission and to not burden the health-care system that will have to take care of the more severe cases. That could result to them feeling isolated, without actually knowing if they are infected, feeling anxious and sick. These people fall though the cracks regarding reported cases.

# 3. Solution Description
> Describe your solution to the problem you identified. How does your solution help solve the problem? How will it benefit society? How will you make it scalable and accessible for the society?

Our solution creates statistics from self reported cases. We have copied the self-diagnosing questionnaire from [corona.sll.se](https://corona.sll.se/) to track symptoms, but are not providing suggestions. The purpose is to identify the cases that might be slipping though the cracks or people that are feeling overwhelmed and think they might be suspecting/fearing they might be infected.
Initially we only are gathering data about the infection to create a reservoir of cases to identify the areas (inn this case Kommun) that are most affected by this crisis, in the sense which areas have the most self reported cases, and people feeling like they are experiencing symptoms. The next step is to add questions about the well-being of the reporters. With the extra information we can produce more accurate results about how this crisis has affected the population psychologically and potentially be able to inform the relevant authorities for the appropriate measures to be taken.   
This is a solution that can be also used in the long term, since the physiological affects of this crisis will be felt for a long time. To facilitate this the questions are going to change to gather the relevant information in each time period.
